## The Project

Form validation built from scratch by React. There are bunch of libraries that provides concrete solutions when it comes to validate the form. I wanted to create my very own form validation that I could later on implement in other projects if I've ever need to. After successful creation, success message will be displayed to user.

## Insight
In this project I've decided to display only one error message instead of display all of the errors. This was done by several if conditions. Regex is the main helper to check for matched results. If user wants to see the password has been typed, they can simply click on the icon and the password will be visible.
